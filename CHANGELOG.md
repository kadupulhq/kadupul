# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project
follows [Semantic Versioning](VERSIONING.md).

## [Unreleased]

Targeting `v1.3.0`, the first planned application release. See
[VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md).

### Fixed

- Run the theme browser suite against the themes shipped by this fork using
  its standalone Playwright configuration.
- Install end-to-end test dependencies without npm lifecycle scripts, and
  download supercronic in the container image over HTTPS only.
- Open the project website, Discussions and Issues links from the midwinter
  theme and the installer with `noopener`.

### Added

- SonarQube Cloud analysis for main and same-repository pull requests.
- Update vendored phpseclib to 3.0.57 and constant_time_encoding to 3.1.3, and lock runtime dependencies.
- Behavioral characterization harness recording 32 contracts from a running
  1.2.31 install, with a differential runner so a rewrite of the internals can
  be compared against what an administrator, plugin or script actually sees.
- Repository scaffolding: continuous integration for PHP 8.1 through 8.4 and
  for JavaScript, Dependabot, issue and pull request templates, and the
  security policy.
- Versioning policy and this changelog.
- Semgrep scanning as a blocking gate, and CodeQL for JavaScript and workflows.
- Releases publish an offline deployment tarball with runtime dependencies
  vendored in, plus a checksum, and a multi-architecture container image.
- Release artefacts carry build provenance, the image is signed with cosign,
  and buildx writes an SBOM into the published index.
- The fork import plan, and the decision that the rename stops at the plugin
  API boundary.
- A production container image: multi-stage, base images pinned by digest, the
  application baked in, and every process running unprivileged.
- The migration design, and `tools/migrate/assess.php`, which reports what a
  existing installation holds and what would survive the move. Read only, so it is safe
  against production.

### Changed

- PHP files a change edits on main move to PER-CS 2.0 formatting, and CI checks
  only those files. The `lts/1.2` branch keeps upstream Cacti formatting.
- File headers carry SPDX copyright and license tags instead of the GPL notice box.
  Inherited files stay GPL-2.0-or-later and files Kadupul created are GPL-3.0-or-later.
- Run SonarQube Cloud analysis on pushes to main and on pull requests.
- Document the 1.2 long-term support line on `lts/1.2`, which ships `v1.2.32`.
- Leave nosemgrep-suppressed findings out of the Semgrep code scanning upload.
- Report an installation exception to the CLI installer as well as to the web installer.
- Refresh localized product names and compiled catalogs, with source-text fallback
  for translations awaiting review.
- Update the shipped graph-watermark default through the shared installer while
  preserving custom values across supported database encodings.
- Show clear graph-rendering failure feedback and handle an unavailable logo.
- Validate branding migrations in CI and reject missing advisory-tooling branches.
- Use Kadupul branding and project contacts across the interface and documentation.
- Remove optional author lists and project-history prose while retaining licensing.
- Build menus and autocomplete items from DOM nodes or DOMPurify output, and
  refuse non-HTTP redirects taken from AJAX responses.
- Exclude vendored libraries from CodeQL and drop workflows that never ran.
- Sanitise AJAX, session-message and DOM-copied markup with DOMPurify before
  inserting it, and build graph images from attribute values.
